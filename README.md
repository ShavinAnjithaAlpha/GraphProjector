# GraphProjector
<p>GraphProjector is 2D simple graphing utility software that builds entirely in Java language. The GraphProjector App has many mathematically graphing functionalities such as plotting simple mathematic functions that had one independent variable, also with the derivative of this function, plotting integrating functions with one or two independent variables, etc...
In addition, the app consists of various kinds of features that can help the user such as live location tracking of the cursor in graphing area, a function slider for live tangent line or normal line of the graph, and an info panel about these lines parameters and graph current position and more. Withal, the user can organize these plotted functions in different color codes in the list view with the delete facility. Another basic feature is also implemented in this app such as zooming, changing grid limits, and integrating over a function. The surprising thing is that the app can be plotting parametric functions with two variables rather than a normal function, with other basic features (zooming, change limit, integrate over function, etc..) and also solve then plotting a simple two-equation differential equation with initial conditions. I looking for making this app with more features. Currently, I have a few ideas about these extending and those are drawing gradient field of function, changing constants over with live user and analyzing functions behaviors, and more. </p>

Here some screen shots of GraphProjector.
